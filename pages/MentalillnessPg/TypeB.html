            <p style="text-indent:50px">
                Every person creates a main focus in life that becomes their passion and individualized
motivational source which influences their goals and mannerisms. Passions and motivations are
essential to understand and strive for, however there are numerous challenging circumstances that
occur while a person is trying to reach their goals and dreams. One such circumstance is when a
patient’s mental health is struggling as it may cause disturbances that occur for a prolonged amount
of time, become distressing to the patient or those around them, and interfere with normal life to an
unfunctional degree and therefore classifying it as a mental health disorder. A major section of
mental health disorders affect the personalities of individuals and the way they act, think, behave,
and feel emotions. Personality disorders are grouped into three different clusters characterized by
either suspicion, emotional dysregulation, or anxiety. Disorders interfering with emotional
regulation are classified as cluster B personality disorders and consist of Borderline, Histrionic,
Narcissistic, and Antisocial personality disorders. Healthy relationships are a crucial aspect when
creating a healthy life, however they are difficult to maintain when a patient has Borderline
Personality Disorder as it deregulates a person’s emotions and impulses, causes extreme mood
swings, and creates distress when maintaining interpersonal relationships or self esteem. While the
need for validation and acceptance are healthy in regulation, the histrionic disorder creates an
extreme and overwhelming desire to be recognized within the patient and causes them to act
dramatically or inappropriately in order to satisfy their reliance on attention, causing great distress
in the patient. A challenging disorder to recognize is Narcissism, which causes an intense yearning
for validation, perfection, and power over others while dampening the patient’s emotions and
empathy in a vicious cycle. When someone is manipulative, impulsive, and often acts on criminal
behavior, they may be diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder which causes the patient to
be unable to feel emotions and lack a sense of punishment or responsibility. In order to effectively
communicate and provide assistance to those affected, the symptoms, effects on relationships and
                lifestyles, and treatments of Cluster B personality disorders must be understood.</p><br>
                
                
   <p style="text-indent:50px">
       Cluster B personality disorders are distressing to the patient and those close to them as the
patient’s interactions with the world may be seen as abnormal or confusing. When people interact
with their environment, they behave in various mannerisms as a result of developing a unique
personality throughout life. When this development of personality is negatively affected by genetic,
environmental, or social influences, it can become a disorder which is explained by a medical
article as “A personality disorder is a way of thinking, feeling and behaving that deviates from the
expectations of the culture, causes distress or problems functioning, and lasts over time” (Robitz).
Personality disorders have been grouped into three clusters with cluster B disorders affecting the
emotions and intensity of a person's behavior. It may be frustrating when attempting to distinguish
between common adolescent developmental behaviors and detrimental or disruptive action
patterns. The vital difference between typical development and a disorder is characterized by the
duration and intensity of the symptoms as explained by one source when they state “Each
personality disorder has its own set of diagnostic criteria. However, according to the DSM-5,
generally the diagnosis of a personality disorder includes long-term marked deviation from cultural
expectations that leads to significant distress or impairment” (Personality Disorders - Diagnosis
And Treatment - Mayo Clinic). Cluster B personality disorders may cause distress in areas such as
emotional regulation, interpersonal relationships, thinking patterns, or physical actions as those
affected experience and react to stimuli according to those deregulated and overwhelming thoughts
and emotions. A professional may be consulted concerning a patient’s troubling behavior and
provide various treatment methods. While personality may appear unable to be affected by
treatment as it is a mental disorder, numerous treatment methods have been developed as shown by
one source as they state “Personality disorders are treatable, however. Often a combination of talk
therapy and medication can go a long way in helping you live with one of these conditions”
(Carey). As a patient is able to recognize unhealthy patterns within their life and apply themself in
treatment programs, they are able to effectively communicate and regulate their thoughts and
emotions. Cluster B personality disorders cause distress and unhealthy patterns to form, however
they can be treated by professionals that provide the opportunity for the patient to return to a
       regulated state of mind. </p><br>
      
 <p style="text-indent:50px">
     Emotional regulation is a crucial aspect of creating wise choices and maintaining healthy
relationships, however those affected by Borderline Personality Disorder find it extremely
challenging to manage distressing emotions and impulses. A part of the cluster B personality
disorders, borderline personality disorder causes severe instability in an individual’s identity,
thinking processes, emotional regulation, and mood swings as shown by one source which states
“Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feel
about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life. It includes self-image
issues, difficulty managing emotions and behavior, and a pattern of unstable relationships”
(Borderline Personality Disorder- Symptoms and Causes). This instability is debilitating in daily
life as overwhelming emotions and sporadic mood swings cause distress and severe confusion
when experiencing an event. The main effect of this instability is the individual’s perception of the
environment and those around them as the labels and feelings placed on people become extreme,
as explained by one source when they state “People with borderline personality disorder also tend
to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also
change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or
traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships” (Borderline
Personality Disorder). This extreme switch between patients with borderline personality and those
without may cause problems to arise in relationships as the patient’s emotions for the other person
can uncontrollably switch to a radical difference as shown by one source who states “Relationships
are tough for those who suffer from BPD as feelings can quickly shift from one of intense love to a
feeling of the recipient not caring enough or not being there for them” (Team). Combined with
overwhelming emotions, any perceived neglect or indifference from a partner may leave a patient
crippled with anxiety and the intense fear of abandonment as the experience of feeling heartbreak
or loneliness causes extreme pain. It is crucial to understand this chronic fear of rejection as it may
cause the individual to resort to problematic or dangerous behaviors. Recognizing the health risks
of borderline personality disorder such as self harm or unhealthy impulses and understanding the
overwhelming and debilitating emotions in those affected by borderline personality allows for
better communication and empathy when an individual is experiencing these painful situations.
While borderline personality disorder may appear too abstract to treat, a practice called Dialectical
Behavioral Thinking (DBT) has produced inspiring results for a diagnosis doctors once thought
impossible to overcome. This practice was created specifically to treat borderline personality and its
incredible results are described by one source as “Research shows it’s incredibly effective—one
study from 2014 showed that 77% of participants no longer met criteria for BPD diagnosis after
undergoing treatment” (Greenstein). When an individual understands and has empathy for
someone with borderline personality, they are able to effectively communicate, help maintain
interpersonal relationships, and find helpful treatments that regulate the extremes of the patient’s
     life.</p> <br>
        
     
      <p style="text-indent:50px">The need for reassurance and validation is vital when interacting with others, however
those with Histrionic personality disorder are distressed by the overwhelming desire for significant
levels of reassurance and recognition. Social interactions are complex as people struggle to
simultaneously acknowledge and express their opinions during discussions with others. Typically
this balance is strained but manageable, however when a person has histrionic personality disorder
their overwhelming desire for complete attention and acknowledgement from others persuades
them to override conversations and social events with unpredictable behavior. Influenced by
intense sporadic emotions, low self esteem, and risky impulsive thinking, histrionic personality
disorder is defined as “... a psychiatric disorder distinguished by a pattern of exaggerated
emotionality and attention-seeking behaviors” (French and Shrestha). Those diagnosed with
histrionic personality disorder suffer from a desire for validation and attention so overwhelming
that their behavior places them in dangerous and risky situations that may cause harm to themselves
or others. These behaviors may cause contention or be seen as manipulative as they are performed
without consideration of others as shown by one source that states “People presenting with
histrionic personality disorder may demonstrate rapidly shifting and shallow emotions that others
may perceive as insincere...Furthermore, they may be dramatic and extremely emotionally
expressive, even embarrassing friends and family with public displays of emotions” (French and
Shrestha). When deprived of recognition, patients with histrionic personality disorder may even
resort to threats of suicide or participate in risky or dangerous sexual behavior regardless of the
consequences these actions may have. The concerning and inappropriate behaviors or actions from
patients with this disorder typically originates from a severe lack of authentic self esteem or neglect.
A lack of authentic self esteem causes an emotional emptiness that a patient believes can only be
remedied with unsatisfiable levels of attention from others as shown by a source when they state
“For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others
and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth. They have an overwhelming desire to be
noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention” (Histrionic Personality
Disorder; Causes, Symptoms and Treatment). People suffering from histrionic personality disorder
are caused great distress as the attention they receive can not truly satisfy their low self esteem and
by the interpersonal relationship problems that may occur after their unpredictable behavior. In
order to manage this distress, treatments that aim to increase authentic self esteem or stabilize
intense emotional changes should be utilized. Treatments such as supportive therapy or mood
stabilizing medication have been shown to be effective at working through problematic thought
processes as shown by one source that states “Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) is generally the
treatment of choice for histrionic personality disorder. The goal of treatment is to help the
individual uncover the motivations and fears associated with his or her thoughts and behavior, and
to help the person learn to relate to others in a more positive way” (Histrionic Personality Disorder;
Causes, Symptoms and Treatment). As an individual with histrionic personality disorder is able to
receive treatments designed to increase self esteem and social skills, they will be able to recognize
problematic behaviors and improve relationships. Empathizing and supporting those with histrionic
personality disorder creates a safe environment for which the affected person will be able to seek
treatment and manage the distress and unhealthy behaviors associated with their lack of self
          esteem. </p><br>
            
    
       <p style="text-indent:50px">
           Self esteem is a necessary aspect of confidence and attitude, however those with
Narcissistic Personality Disorder are oblivious to the emotions of others due to their own
uncontrollable obsession for perfection and power, ultimately causing themselves and those close
to them distress when this is not achieved. A person diagnosed with Narcissistic personality
disorder experiences unhealthy obsessions with aspects in their life such as success, perfection, and
attention from those they respect. Classified as a personality disorder, narcissism is severe
compared to the typical social concept as shown by one source that states “Narcissistic personality
disorder — one of several types of personality disorders — is a mental condition in which people
have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration,
troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others” (Narcissistic Personality Disorder -
Symptoms And Causes). Influenced by their lack of empathy, actions taken by those with
narcissistic personality disorder may seem ingenuine or irrational as shown by one source that
states “Individuals with NPD can be easily stung by criticism or defeat and may react with disdain
or anger—but social withdrawal or the false appearance of humility may also follow according to
the DSM-5” (Narcissistic Personality Disorder). While narcissists have an irrational sense of
importance, they actually suffer from an incredibly fragile self esteem they aim to protect by
appearing invulnerable and superior with their accomplishments. Protecting an individual’s self
esteem is encouraged and healthy unless it is achieved in unconventional or harmful ways as
shown by one source examining narcissists and their behaviors “Individuals suffering with
narcissistic personality disorder will often exhibit traits of arrogance, dominance, superiority, and
the desire to seek power. However, most of these individuals typically struggle with low
self-esteem and often attempt to compensate for this fragility by degrading others” (Narcissistic
Personality Disorder Causes, Statistics, Signs, Symptoms & Side Effects). This unempathetic
compensation of degrading and humiliating others in order to alleviate an individual’s
embarrassment is a major indicator of narcissism and causes great harm in relationships. Combined
with an immense sense of superiority and a lack of empathy, a narcissist may be inclined to utilize
manipulative, dramatic, or insincere behaviors to attempt to satisfy their intense desire for
admiration with a partner or social group. Harmful behaviors from narcissists originate from their
viewpoint that those around them are only there to provide praise or to be used to gain praise as
shown by the quote “Narcissists view partners as trophies under their power and may expect
partners to show deference and adoring behavior throughout the relationship. Manipulation of a
partner is emotional abuse, and narcissists resort to some pretty low behaviors if they feel that they
are losing their hold on a partner” (Deggs). Abusive behavior is an indicator that treatment is
necessary in order for change to occur, however those with narcissistic personality disorder may
not believe that they have the diagnosis or that they need treatment as shown by one source that
states “It is also difficult for narcissists to recognize the distorted and unhealthy patterns of their
thinking and behaviors. This can make getting treatment difficult, though it is not impossible”
(Narcissistic Personality Disorder Relationships – Bridges To Recovery). While treatment is
challenging to accept or believe in, there are a multitude of processes professionals utilize in order
to help the patient and individuals affected as explained by one source as “Successful therapy for
narcissistic personality disorder includes a series of steps, including helping patients to find relief
from immediate distress, recognize unhealthy coping mechanisms, develop new coping skills,
unpack childhood experiences, learn to empathize with themselves, and eventually learn to
empathize with others and live authentically” (Narcissistic Personality Disorder). It may be
intimidating to recognize flaws and vulnerabilities in an individual's personality or self esteem,
however with safe treatment the supportive process will regulate harmful behaviors and improve
relationships. It is necessary to recognize the unhealthy behaviors of individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder in order to safely interact with or care for them and to maintain interpersonal
           relationships. </p><br>
            
           
         <p style="text-indent:50px">
             Consequences are a major influence on actions or behaviors in social settings, however
those with Antisocial Personality Disorder lack the ability to distinguish right from wrong and do
not have the emotions necessary to claim responsibility. Those diagnosed with antisocial
personality disorder suffer from a multitude of complex symptoms and mental processes which
affect their thought processes as explained by one source which states “ASPD is a deeply
ingrained and dysfunctional thought process that focuses on social exploitive, delinquent, and
criminal behavior most commonly known due to the affected individual's lack of remorse for these
behaviors” (Fisher and Hany). Deviant and dangerous behaviors do not carry the weight of
punishment for those with antisocial personality disorder as a lack of remorse creates an inability to
be emotionally affected. An inability to be emotionally affected may lead to a sense of superiority
and the prospect that any harmful or manipulative impulse can be acted on without true punishment
as shown by one source that states “Disregard for and the violation of others' rights are common
manifestations of this personality disorder, which displays symptoms that include failure to conform
to the law, inability to sustain consistent employment, deception, manipulation for personal gain,
and incapacity to form stable relationships” (Fisher and Hany). It may seem that those with
antisocial personality disorder are destined to become criminals and stay detached from other
people their entire life, however this is not the case as shown by one source that states “Studies of
people in prison do reveal high rates of ASPD, but this condition occurs on a spectrum, and not
everyone living with the condition becomes violent or dangerous. Research has also observed that
some people who display antisocial traits may have developed these behaviors in order to survive
and protect themselves when growing up in difficult circumstances” (Raypole). Recognizing
where a patient resides on this spectrum of antisocial personality disorder is vital when attempting
to interact or maintain relationships; the higher they are on the spectrum means that punishment or
emotional connections may not have an effect on decreasing unwanted behavior. It has been
shown however, that patients are able to form connections with others as trust and love are
introduced as shown by one source that states “People living with ASPD often struggle to develop
or maintain meaningful relationships, and they may cause emotional harm to their partners; but it’s
still possible for people with ASPD to feel love and empathy, often for a select few people such as
children, partners, or close family members” (Raypole). While it may be unstable, the fact that
patients are able to form connections with others grants invaluable insight when providing
treatment to patients from professionals. Effective treatment for this personality disorder involves a
change in unhealthy thinking patterns and is explained by one source as they state “It’s possible for
people who have ASPD to avoid actions that could harm others, especially when they have
support from a compassionate therapist. In therapy, people can develop interpersonal skills along
with coping techniques for impulsivity and aggression” (Raypole). Challenging as it may be, with
effective treatment, healthy boundaries with communication, and a strong understanding of the
struggles of those with antisocial personality disorder, a manageable and healthy relationship can
be maintained. When the limits and spectrum of antisocial personality disorder are understood and
             healthy boundaries are established, relationships are able to form and alleviate distress.</p><br>
            
            
                <p style="text-indent:50px">Behaviors and mental processes that are expressed by an individual creates their
personality and influences their future actions. Personality is an essential aspect of identity and
determines the thoughts and emotions that affect a person’s daily life. These thoughts and emotions
can sometimes be overwhelming for an individual, however they typically reduce in intensity over
time and return to normal. However when overwhelming emotions and impulsive thoughts remain
over a long period of time, cause distress in relationships, or impares the individual’s ability to
function, it may become a medical issue. Personalities that promote harmful behavior or intense emotions over extended periods of time may be diagnosed as a personality disorder that requires
treatment in order to allow the patient to properly function. The disruption of regulated emotions is
attributed to personality disorders comprising the B cluster; typically recognized as the erratic and
impulsive group of personality disorders. In order to provide effective assistance to those with
cluster B personality disorders, the symptoms, effects on relationships and lifestyles, and treatments
regarding the specific disorder must be recognized and implemented. One such disorder is
borderline personality disorder, characterized by intense emotions, impulsive behavior, and
unstable relationships whose symptoms are typically treated with dialectical behavior therapy. A
severe lack of self esteem and a reliance on the validation of others is typically seen in histrionic
personality disorder, which negatively affects relationships and social events but can be treated
with therapy. While they do not have high self esteem, those with narcissistic personality disorder
present themselves as perfect individuals, however without behavioral therapy they may become
hostile, degrading, and unempathetic to those they see as imperfect. Characterized by unstable
relationships and a lack of remorse, those with antisocial personality disorder lack the emotions
necessary to understand the difference between good and bad, but harmful behaviors can be
regulated with therapy. The actions and behaviors of those with personality disorders may seem
incurable and while the disorder itself may not leave, with effective treatments and support groups
the patient will be able to regulate their emotions and behaviors and function once again. It is
necessary to recognize the symptoms of each disorder in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and
implement effective treatment. In order to effectively communicate and provide assistance to those
affected, the symptoms, effects on relationships and lifestyles, and treatments of Cluster B
                    personality disorders must be understood.</p><br>
