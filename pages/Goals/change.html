        <p style="text-indent:50px">Oftentimes challenges in life are involuntary, placed upon a person with varying
severity and no possible end in sight. While changing the actual situation may not be
possible, a person’s attitude toward the situation can be controlled and changed. Positive and
negative attitudes influence the perspective and evaluation of an experience. When there is an
adjustment in attitude there is a multitude of effects that take place. These changes in attitude
can control the focus of the situation and whether it emphasizes positive or negative aspects.
It affects whether a strong or weak confidence is projected when handling a situation and the
ability to take charge. The level of motivation to seek out opportunities that are in experiences
is determined by the attitude one choses. The attitude people choose when faced with life
challenges affects their mental focus, confidence, and overall outcomes.</p>
        
        
        <p style="text-indent:50px">When faced with a series of experiences a person will form an attitude that will
determine the mental judgement of a situation. Attitude has been researched and can be
defined as “a bodily state of readiness to respond in a characteristic way to a stimulus”
("Attitude: Definition, Nature And Characteristics (Explained)"). This means when a situation
or a stimulus affects someone, a predetermined mental process takes effect and the person
reacts in a way typical to the situation with emotions, thoughts, or actions. Gordon Allport
once commented on attitude and its effects by saying “An attitude is a mental and neural state
of readiness, organized through experience, exerting a directive or dynamic influence upon
the individual’s response to all objects and situations with which it is related” (Fazio). Allport
explains that attitude is able to influence the perception and process one takes when entering a
challenge. Attitude is able to contribute to the overall experience of a situation and is referred
upon when entering other experiences that exemplifies the same stimulus. Positive and
negative attitudes influence the perception of an experience and a person’s mindset when it is
being assessed. Positive attitude has been studied and the mental processes involved can be
explained by people such as Remez Sasson, who provides an example when saying; “People
with a positive outlook, view life, challenges, and the situations they go through, with
confidence and are sure they can deal with them...People with a positive attitude will not let
failure or obstacles stand in their way, and will always try to find ways to overcome them”
(Sasson). This positive attitude is one that is optimal when striving to overcome challenges.
Negative attitude focuses on the unfortunate aspects of a situation or causes the person to
become close minded to change. Attitude is a mental process of a predispositioned inference
that affects a person’s perspective on a challenge and influences their decisions.</p>
        
        
        <p style="text-indent:50px">There can be various outcomes to a situation and the thoughts or feelings one has
within that time are important to the end outcome. These thoughts and feelings can originate
from an attitude whether it be positive or negative. Attitude has the ability to influence one’s
focus point when entering a situation by altering a person’s perception. This can be explained
by Brandon West when he says; “You cannot control what is currently happening to you in
your life, but what you can control is your attitude towards what is happening in your life, in
every respect. And thus by shifting your attitude, you also shift your perspective and change
what you attract into your life” (West). West explains that attitude can be controlled even
while other aspects cannot, but through this the focus point of a person’s life can be changed.
A focus point is any stimulus or aspect of an event that is inherently unbiased, however
attitude can affect the opinions that label it as desirable or undesirable. When assessing a
situation, positive attitudes focus on overcoming a situation, while negative attitudes focus on
the undesirable aspects of a situation. If one has the challenge of cleaning the dishes there
may be various aspects to focus on within the task. A negative attitude might focus on
undesirable aspects and cause frustration for the entirety of the time they work. If a positive
attitude is applied there is a focus on the opportunistic aspects such as a learning opportunity
or a chance to procrastinate from other work, causing possible feelings of being content while
cleaning. These attitudes did not change the situation, but instead influenced the perspective
and thought process when evaluating the focus point. The mental focus points of a situation
are affected when a positive or negative attitude is chosen.</p>
        
        
        <p style="text-indent:50px">It is important to oneself and others that a strong confidence is projected when
approaching a situation. Confidence is the ability for someone to believe in and act with full
faith in themself or their belief. This may cause someone to be perceived in a respectful
manner as they follow through with an idea and inspire change in a situation. A positive or
negative attitude may affect whether there is a strong or weak confidence projected. Positive
attitude causes the person to view the experience as an opportunity for learning and may
utilize a mindset to overcome that challenge. Leaving their social insecurities or anxieties
aside, they take charge and change the situation to fit their needs. Poor attitude views the
situation as undefeatable or as an exhaustion of valuable time. This view leads to a shy, weak,
or socially unwelcome projection that restricts opportunities. If a person choses a positive
attitude when handling problems in a relationship, they might take charge and try to find
solutions as they believe those problems can be overcome. If a person choses a negative
attitude towards the same problems they may abandon the relationship as they believe there is
nothing that can be done to save it. This misfortune is caused by attitudinal effects on
confidence and therefore on a person’s belief in their ability to create change. Confidence
determines the projected power one has to take charge and change as a situation and it is
affected by a positive or negative attitude.</p>
        
        
        <p style="text-indent:50px">Opportunities exist in all challenges and situations in life. These opportunities can be
difficult to notice, however with different attitudes one can uncover a multitude of chances
for growth. Some examples of these could include discovering new information on a topic,
meeting a famous person at an event, or stumbling upon the chance for money. These
experiences and opportunities can only be discovered if one has a positive attitude and an
open mind to interpret situations in their own favor. A healthy attitude may lead to an
exploration of options to alleviate or solve a situation quickly and in a self serving manner.
Healthy attitudes can lead to learning healthy mechanisms and leave the person with a sense
of fulfillment. This is because they view the situation as unfortunate and challenging but not
impossible as they learn to overcome it. An unhealthy attitude may lead to an isolated and
uncomfortable mindset that prevents opportunities for growth. This can lead to unhealthy
mechanisms or general lack of happiness as they view situations as impossible to overcome or
that they can obtain nothing else from the experience. Negative attitude restricts growth by
focusing on the misfortune of the situation and appears to be too arduous to change. An
excellent example is provided by the site Health Status as they claim; “A positive attitude also
inclines us towards taking on new challenges and learning new skills. This means we are
more likely to get involved in sports or other activities where we are not immediately
successful. An individual with a negative attitude submits up at the first unsuccessful attempt
— making it difficult to master a new skill”(Scheidl, and Scheidl). This explains that those
with positive attitudes strive for and persevere in order to accomplish goals while those with a
negative attitude will become defeated as they do not see a hopeful outcome. These attitudes
change the willingness for the person to search for new opportunities within a challenge and
experience new aspects in life.</p>
        
        
        <p style="text-indent:50px">Attitude is important and affects aspects of how challenges are assessed and acted
upon. It has the ability to change one’s perspective and influence their emotions of an event.
When choosing an attitude typically it is either positive or negative with both affecting the
ability for one to accomplish a task. A positive attitude focuses on the ability for one to
accomplish challenges and seek new opportunities. A negative attitude focuses on the
unfortunate circumstances of a situation and confides the person in their own mind. These
differences in attitude can affect the focus point of a situation and the aspects that are judged.
It can also affect the confidence one projects in a challenge as it allows them to empower
themself and seek change. Lastly it affects how open minded a person is during an experience
and the opportunities they can find and expand upon. It is important to choose an attitude that
serves one’s purpose well and brings healthy outcomes in the long run for the person. The
attitude one has when faced with challenges in life affects their mental focus, confidence, and
the open mindedness one has to seek out opportunities.</p>
