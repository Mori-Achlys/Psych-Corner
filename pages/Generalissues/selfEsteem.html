            <h1 align="center"> Challenges with and solutions for low self esteem </h1>
            <p style="text-indent:50px">Self esteem is the ability to respect oneself and act in a way that empowers pride in one’s talents and intuition. While difficult to achieve, self esteem allows for security and confidence in the abilities of oneself and allows one to take charge. Many times people have difficulty making decisions or thinking and acting for themself. This product of low self esteem may lead to stress and anxiety whenever placed in common situations and cause the persons to act in a way that is not true to themself. There are several solutions to this issue which increase self esteem and focus on the care for and consideration of oneself. Thinking of and for oneself in a situation allows for self love and confidence to form. Finding and expanding on activities one is interested in can induce a flow state where they can produce products created in times of enjoyment, and later look upon them with greater elevated emotions and pride of themself. If these solutions do not work and change is needed, then they should be worked on in a healthy and self-caring way. Focusing on solutions that provide respect and improvement of oneself can strengthen one’s self esteem. Practicing skills such as thinking for oneself, expanding on interests, and changing in a healthy way can overcome the challenge of low self esteem. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:50px">It is oftentimes difficult to voice opinions as the fear of disapproval or imposing opinions on others may upset someone in a way. This fear of expression can be attributed to low self esteem as one does not believe their opinion is equal in worth to the other’s. However, an essential part of self esteem is confidence as it allows for someone to more readily think for and make decisions that are true to themselves. Confidence in self allows one to take a step forward to achieving self esteem as one is able to feel proud of progress when they make a choice and follow through with it. This confidence can be practiced and may present itself in situations both common and extreme. When a person asks for one’s opinion for where to eat one night oftentimes it is tempting to ask for their opinion instead. However, realize that when they ask for the opinion they truly wish to know one’s preference and while they may not agree with the choice they appreciate the response and hold no grudge. Practicing responding to
questions like this allows for a smoother and more truthful choice making when serious situations arise in the future, such as choosing a car or a house with a friend or spouse. These experiences allow one to trust and care for themself as their honest opinions are expressed and therefore strengthen their self esteem.</p>
                
                <p style="text-indent:50px">At times it may feel like activities or hobbies are not fulfilling in life. This disconnect may induce a lack of motivation and less effort into those activities may occur, leading to an end product one is not proud of. This cycle may lead to low self esteem as a person compares their products to others, feeling inferior and unhappy with themself and their abilities. In order to combat this, finding and exploring topics or interests one genuinely likes may in turn allow one to find what they truly enjoy. If one finds something that is truly fulfilling, that activity or
hobby may lead to a flow state. A flow state is being ‘in the zone’ and typically occurs when someone is fully immersed in an activity where the emotions of excitement and genuine interest exist. Expanding upon one’s likes connected to the flow state will allow one to produce
products created in times of enjoyment. When later looked upon these products or memories will grant greater elevated emotions and pride. This can lead to higher self esteem as they are satisfied with their work and therefore themself as they created what they are proud of and will not compare themselves to others as harshly as before.</p>
            
                <p style="text-indent:50px">If an individual truly feels like they have undesirable traits such as low productivity, unwanted body proportions, or emotional intensity, then those traits should be worked on in a healthy and a self-worth focused manner. These undesirable traits may cloud judgements and cause low self esteem as one views themself in a negative light. Working to return these aspects to a healthy level can increase self esteem as one reaches a goal or simply is content with the trait returning to the desired level. However, this does not mean to achieve the goal through unhealthy practices. When one tries to change a trait with the mindset of completion by any means necessary it is not healthy but destructive and may become an unhealthy obsession. Working on oneself should only be done with a healthy and self caring mindset. Goals should be practiced in a productive and self caring manner with clear, possible, and maintainable goals. There are
many sources that explain the correct way to create and maintain healthy goals such as Team Toby on the website Tonyrobbins where they advise: “Unlike their counterparts – goals that are vague, overambitious or unplanned – SMART goal setting puts you on point for getting what
you want in life... SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and anchored within a Time Frame”. Setting and achieving goals in a healthy manner such as this increases self esteem as there is a feeling of personal growth from both changing the trait and the ability to achieve a healthy goal.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:50px">Low self esteem prevents traits such as confidence and respect for oneself from occurring. Practicing strategies that focus on confidence, expanding on interests, and creating healthy goals allow for an easy and efficient manner in which to achieve a higher self esteem. Speaking for oneself and expressing opinions allows for trust and validation which empowers the self. Expanding on interests may lead to a flow state that will allow one to produce products created in times of enjoyment and allow for pride in oneself.Creating smart goals in order to change a trait of the self in a healthy manner provides satisfaction with the achievement itself as well as the manner it was achieved, utilizing self care and pride. These traits along with a healthy self esteem increase a confidence and image others can pick up on and respect. Self esteem can be obtained through these practices that allow the individual to respect and trust themself as they focus on self care and empowerment.</p>
